## 62ZOC Insurance Act statutory managers-termination of control

Conditions necessary for termination of control

- (1) If APRA assumes control of a body corporate's business or appoints an administrator of a body corporate's business, APRA must ensure that either it or an administrator of the body corporate's business has control of the body corporate's business until:
- (a) APRA considers that it is no longer necessary for it or an administrator to remain in control of the body corporate's business; or
- (b) APRA has applied for the body corporate to be wound up. A termination of control that is permitted under this section is called an ultimate termination of control .

Note:

This provision does not prevent a change, or changes, between control of a body corporate's business by APRA and an administrator or between administrators.

Events to precede termination

- (2) Before making an ultimate termination of control by an Insurance Act statutory manager of a body corporate's business, APRA must: (a) do both of the following:
- (i) ensure that directors of the body corporate have been appointed or elected under the body corporate's constitution at a meeting called by the statutory manager in accordance with the body corporate's constitution;
- (ii) if the body corporate is a foreign general insurerappoint an agent in Australia for the purpose of section 118 by instrument in writing; or
- (b) do both of the following:
- (i) appoint directors of the body corporate by instrument in writing;
- (ii) if the body corporate is a foreign general insurerappoint an agent in Australia for the purpose of section 118 by instrument in writing; or

- (c) ensure that a liquidator has been appointed:
- (i) unless subparagraph (ii) applies-for the body corporate; or
- (ii) if the body corporate is a foreign general insurer-for the body corporate in relation to its Australian business assets and liabilities.

Power to terminate control

- (3) If the requirements in subsections (1) and (2) are satisfied, APRA may by instrument in writing make an ultimate termination of control of a body corporate's business by an Insurance Act statutory manager.
- (4) If the Insurance Act statutory manager at the time of the termination is an administrator, the instrument of termination also operates as a termination of the appointment of the administrator. A copy of the instrument must be given to the administrator. However, mere failure to give the copy to the administrator does not affect the termination of the appointment.

## Period of director's appointment

- (5) If a director is elected or appointed under subsection (2), the director takes office on the termination of the Insurance Act statutory manager's control of the body corporate's business. If the director was appointed by APRA, the director holds office until the body corporate's next annual general meeting, subject to any terms and conditions imposed by APRA on the director's appointment. If the director was appointed or elected under the body corporate's constitution, the constitution governs the appointment.

## Section 62ZZH

## 62ZZH Entitlement on basis of notionally extended cover

- (1) If the period of insurance cover provided under a protected policy issued by a general insurer, or in respect of which liability has been accepted by a general insurer, includes the time when the insurer becomes a declared general insurer, sections 62ZZF, 62ZZFA, 62ZZG, 62ZZGA, 62ZZI and 62ZZJ apply as if the period of the cover extended for 28 days after that time, even if:
- (a) the policy is cancelled within those 28 days; or
- (b) the period of the cover would otherwise have ended before the end of those 28 days.

Note:

The effects of applying sections 62ZZF, 62ZZFA, 62ZZG and 62ZZGA as if the period of cover were extended include those sections applying as if:

- (a) the entitlement to claim under that cover were correspondingly extended; and
- (b) the liability of the insurer were also extended in respect of such claims.

## 116A Assets and liabilities in Australia

- (1) For the purposes of sections 28, 62M, 62ZZC and 62ZZE, an amount is taken to be an asset in Australia of a general insurer if:
- (a) the insurer expects to recover the amount under a contract of reinsurance entered into with a person who is outside Australia; and
- (b) the amount relates to claims in respect of liabilities in Australia of the insurer, whether or not the claims have been paid by the insurer; and
- (c) under the terms of the contract, payments by way of reinsurance are to be made in Australia.

Note 1:

Section 28 requires general insurers to hold sufficient assets.

Note 2:

Section 62M provides for the appointment of a judicial manager for a foreign general insurer if its assets in Australia referred to in that section are, or are likely to become, insufficient to enable it to meet its liabilities in Australia other than pre-authorisation liabilities as they become due.

- Note 3: Sections 62ZZC and 62ZZE are concerned with APRA believing a foreign general insurer is unable to pay, from its assets in Australia referred to in those sections, all its debts that are liabilities in Australia other than pre-authorisation liabilities, as and when those debts become due and payable.
- (2) For the purposes of sections 28, 62M, 62ZZC, 62ZZE and 116, a liability is taken to be a liability in Australia of a general insurer if it is undertaken by the insurer under a contract of insurance (including reinsurance) made in Australia or in respect of which a proposal was accepted or a policy issued in Australia, other than a contract:
- (a) that relates only to a liability contingent on an event that can happen only outside Australia, not being a liability that the body corporate has undertaken to satisfy in Australia; or

292

Insurance Act 1973

Note:

Subsection 116(3) gives priority to discharge of liabilities in Australia when a general insurer is being wound up.

- (3) For the purposes of sections 28, 62M, 62ZZC, 62ZZE and 116, a liability is also taken to be a liability in Australia of a general insurer if it is undertaken by the insurer under a contract of insurance (including reinsurance) made outside Australia or in respect of which a proposal was accepted or a policy issued outside Australia, if the contract:
- (a) relates to a liability contingent on an event that can happen only in Australia; or
- (b) if the insurer carries on insurance business both in and outside Australia-relates to a liability that the insurer has undertaken to satisfy in Australia;

and any part of the negotiations or arrangements leading to the making of the contract, the acceptance of the proposal or the issue of the policy took place or were made in Australia.

- (4) For the purposes of sections 28, 62M, 62ZZC, 62ZZE and 116, unless the contrary intention appears, a reference to liabilities of a body corporate includes a reference to provision for liabilities made in its accounts, or directed in accordance with section 104 to be made, but does not include:
- (a) a liability in respect of share capital; or
- (b) where the body corporate is registered under section 21 of the Life Insurance Act 1995 , a liability that is, in accordance with that Act:
- (i) referable to a class of life insurance business carried on by the body corporate in respect of which it has established a statutory fund under that Act; or
- (ii) charged on any of the assets of such a statutory fund.
- (5) The whole or such part as APRA determines of an amount owed to a body corporate by way of portions of premiums retained under a contract of reinsurance by a person outside Australia is, for the

## (6) Where:

- (a) a determination has been made under subsection (5); and
- (b) it appears at any time to APRA that the determination is no longer necessary or should be varied;

APRA must, by notice in writing served on the body corporate concerned, revoke or vary the determination, as the case may be.

- (7) Part VI applies to a decision by APRA under subsection (5) or (6) to determine an amount or to vary such a determination.

## 117 Address for service in Australia

- (1) A body corporate that is not incorporated in Australia and:
- (a) is a foreign general insurer; or
- (b) is a subsidiary of a foreign general insurer;

must, at all times, have an address for service in Australia for the purposes of this Act.

- (2) An address becomes the address for service for the insurer or subsidiary when written notice of the address is given to APRA. (The address continues to be the address for service until APRA is given written notice of another address.)
- (3) If:
- (a) written notice has been given to APRA of an address for service in Australia for a foreign general insurer; and
- (b) a body corporate that is a subsidiary of the foreign general insurer is not incorporated in Australia; and
