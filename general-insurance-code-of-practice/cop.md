## General Insurance Code of Practice

<!-- image -->

Setting out standards of conduct for the general insurers who have adopted the Code and their Employees, Distributors and Service Suppliers.

## President's foreword

On behalf of the Board of the Insurance Council of Australia, I am pleased to present this updated version of the General Insurance Code of Practice 2020, which came into effect on 5 October 2021.

The industry understands the vital role it plays in the community and the economy and the General Insurance Code of Practice continues to set a benchmark for self-regulation in th e fin ancial services sector. The 2020 Code was developed by the industry in consultation with multiple stakeholders and the result is the most customer-focused Code in its history, and one reflecting evolving community expectations. This includes a strong focus on supporting customers experiencing vulnerability.

Most of the 2020 Code started on 1 July 2021, however some obligations, such as having a publicly available family violence policy, and the Supporting Customers Experiencing Vulnerability and Financial Hardship parts, took effect earlier.

As the Code is a living document, some adjustments have now been made in this October 2021 version to align with ASIC's new guidelines for complaints handling. For example, a new timeframe to resolve a complaint has been introduced reducing the time from 45 to 30 days.

There is also a new commitment to promote improved awareness about the availability of Financial Hardship support on Code subscriber's websites.

The Code reflects the general insurance industry's ongoing commitment to positive outcomes for consumers and its determination to provide best practice in conduct and customer service.

I welcome the latest version of the 2020 Code and its ongoing improvements.

## General insurance in our society

## Life can be unpredictable.

Insurance can help protect you from life's unpredictability. Some of the ways general insurance can protect you are:

- · for loss or damage to your valuable possessions - such as your home or car, or even your Small Businesses and infrastructure;
- · for your responsibility, or 'liability', to another person if you cause them loss or damage; and
- · for loss you suffer from certain events such as travel cancellation and many types of natural disasters.

By helping you to manage the financial impact of insured events, insurance can help reduce your stress.

Although insurance is important in your personal and business affairs, insurance and the insurance industry - underpin the Australian financial system. It does this by insuring risks for people and for the community and by helping them to rebuild and replace their assets after insured losses. Where a risk is not insured the burden of loss may have to be borne by the community. The insurance industry also contributes to improved risk management.

## The Code

The General Insurance Code of Practice (the Code) was introduced in 1994 by the Insurance Council of Australia as a voluntary Code. It has been regularly reviewed and updated.

The Code is independently monitored and enforced by the Code Governance Committee.

The Code has been developed through consultation with a range of stakeholders including consumer and industry representatives, the Code Governance Committee, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Financial Complaints Authority.

The Code is intended to be a positive influence across all aspects of the general insurance industry including product disclosure, claims handling and investigations, relationships with people who are experiencing vulnerability, and reporting obligations.

## Meeting community needs, standards and expectations

The general insurance industry is an integral part of an inclusive, thriving and adaptable community.

The industry must always strive to meet the community's evolving expectations for how it should support individuals and small businesses.

The Code is a key way the general insurance industry makes sure it continues:

- · to work towards this important goal; and
- · to provide value to you and the whole community.

## Our principles

The principles that underpin the Code shape the way the general insurance industry behaves, treats people and approaches decision-making.

We - the general insurance industry - will be inclusive by providing insurance designed to meet the diverse and changing needs of the whole community.

## We will provide value, transparency and fairness of products and services by:

- · designing and selling insurance products and services that are of value to the community they are sold to;
- · designing and selling insurance products and services in a clear, transparent and fair manner; and
- · continually reviewing and improving insurance products and services offered to ensure they remain of value to the changing needs of the community.

## We will promote trust, integrity and respect by:

- · meeting promises made to the community in a trusting environment;
- · being open, fair and understanding, and acting with integrity, in our dealings with the community;
- · being clear, transparent, fair and timely in our communications with the community; and
- · treating the community with respect, dignity and sensitivity.

## We will provide accessibility and additional support by:

- · being accessible to the community and making our processes simple and timely; and
- · assisting members of the community who are in need of additional support.

## We will resolve any concerns and work to prevent future concerns by:

- · listening and seeking to resolve concerns in an objective, truthful and timely manner;
- · proactively resolving any concerns we may identify; and
- · monitoring any concerns identified, and making changes to prevent similar future concerns when this is reasonable.

We will add value to the community by engaging with the government, consumers and other relevant stakeholders in building an inclusive, thriving and adaptable community.

Complaints about the repairer's conduct, timeliness, quality of work or the materials they use will be handled under our Complaints process.
- 87. If we have selected and directly authorised a repairer and we are satisfied that the repair requires rectification and because of that you need a hire car or accommodation over and above what we would provide to you in your policy, then we will arrange these for you and cover the reasonable costs.

We will give you 12 months from the date of finalisation of your claim to ask for a review of your claim. We will inform you in writing about this entitlement and our Complaints process when we finalise your claim.

- 197. During the review, the Employee will determine if there is sufficient cause for the investigation into your claim to continue. If it is determined that the investigation should stop, then your claim will be referred for a decision as set out in part 8.
- 198. The review process will not exceed 30 Calendar Days. If we do not complete the review and notify you of the outcome within that time, we will tell you in writing about our Complaints process.
- 199. After the review, we will tell you in writing, why we have not been able to make a decision on your claim and any information we still need that we do not have.
- 200. To ensure our investigations are appropriately focused:
- a. we will ensure that any requests to you for more information, or documents, are reasonable and relevant to the claim under investigation. We will:

- 207. If an independent interpreter is needed either for you, or for us, we will arrange for this at our cost.
- 208. If you tell us, or we identify, that you need additional support or have other particular needs, then we will arrange for the Investigator or Employee to be someone who we are satisfied has appropriate training or experience to conduct the interview in light of those needs.
- 209. If you request for the Investigator, or Employee appointed to investigate your claim, to be the same gender as you we will tell you if we can arrange for this. We may not be able to do this if it is not reasonably practical for us to do so.

## During the formal interview

- 212. When the interview happens, the Investigator, or Employee appointed to investigate your claim, will ask you a series of questions about the information contained in the interview consent form. Those questions are designed to make sure we have your consent to the interview (or not).

- 216. If the total interview time required is over 4 hours, the Investigator or the Employee appointed to investigate your claim must obtain written consent from us. In that written consent, we will provide the reasons why this time extension is needed.
- 217. If during the interview it becomes apparent that an interpreter is needed either for you, or for us, (even though one had not previously been requested or arranged), then the Investigator or Employee will:
- a. pause the interview; and
- b. restart it at a later time, or date, once an independent interpreter has been arranged.

- b. advise you of the support person's role in the interview process in accordance with paragraph 205(h); and

However, if you tell us - or we identify - that you are experiencing vulnerability, then there will be a 5 minute break every 30 minutes. Any break is a time-out and is not included in the 90 minute period referred to under paragraph 214.
- 220. Also, you can request additional breaks and stop the interview early and reschedule if needed.

- 221. The Investigator or Employee must record all offers of breaks, and the interviewee's responses.

## After the formal interview

222. We will offer you a transcript of the formal interview (or a digital copy of the recorded interview), and it will be given to you for free. You can also request this at a later time and it will be provided for free.

- 223. Also, if we need to interview you more than once, then before the second or any later interview, we will give you a copy of the record of your previous interview.

## External Investigators only
